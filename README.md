# NoSQL Challenge

This repository contains data from the UK Food Standards Agency on restaurants and their hygiene ratings around the United Kingdom. The data is in the form of a json file that can be found in the Resources Folder. This file was then imported into a Mongo Database and using Pymongo the data was updated, cleaned, and analyzed to determine food safety performance for restaurant across UK. The code for this can be found in two Jupyter Notebook files, the first being the set up file where data is inserted as well as dataypes are changed. Then in the analysis file, queries are used to find safety performances of the data and then the results are turned to pandas DataFrames.
